- **Topics Covered:** GitHub Basics will cover the fundamentals of GitHub use, communication, and collaboration.
- **Length of Course:** This course consists of 5 modules and will take you between 2-4 hours to complete.
- **Prerequisites:** An introduction to GitHub like this [training for the Office of Immunization](https://stateofwa.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/DOH-GitUsersGroup/ER4nGr6eN_lFm3fb6yL67S0BN3xQhNnWO92N46GBRIKg9w?e=xpC2h7) is helpful, but _not required_.

**Course tips:**

* Glossary terms will be _emphasised_ and linked to their definition. 
* This course includes optional video links. Look for the :tv: emoji and follow the link to the video.

## How to start this course

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.\
   <br />[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/218596841-0645fe1a-4aaf-4f51-9ab3-8aa2d3fdd487.svg)](https://github.com/DOH-Epi-Coders/GitHub-Basics/generate)
2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose the `DOH-Epi-Coders` organization
   - Suggested name: `GitHub-Basics-DOH-ABC1234` - i.e. replace `ABC1234` with your username
   - Use the `Internal` visibility setting
   - Click the green `Create repository from template` button\

3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh your new repository page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically close this `Getting Started` and open the first module `Fundamentals`.

Please read and follow these instructions carefully.

### 1.1  What is Git and GitHub?
**Git** is software you install on your computer that enables you to track the history of changes to files – known as a version control system or VCS. This can be used individually or collaboratively and locally or remotely. Git is often accessed with command-line, but there are graphical interfaces –called _Git clients_— that make most common tasks in Git accessible with the click of a button.

:tv: [Watch this video for an introduction on version control](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control) (6 min)

**GitHub** is a web-platform that extends the functionality of Git. It can store Git repositories and provides additional tools for communication, collaboration, project management, and code development with Git as its core. GitHub is designed like a social media platform but for project collaboration and code development. GitHub is what we'll be focusing on in this training.

### 1.2  How are staff at WADOH using these platforms?
WADOH staff are encouraged to store and collaborate on their code projects using GitHub. Our goal is for all projects utilizing code to be stored on and utilized from GitHub. Here's are some examples of how teams are making use of the platform:
- As a convenient location to store, document, share, and transfer projects
- Collaborating on complex code development with GitHub's project management tools and workflows
- Capturing feedback directly from stakeholders and using it to develop and prioritize task lists for current or future projects
- Integrating GitHub's version control and automation with other cloud applications in CEDAR
- Creating internal websites
- Creating Q&A discussions for documenting questions and solutions
- As a means to reduce silos, share knowledge, and establish standard best practices

### 1.3  WADOH GitHub enterprise conditions of use
Please read the conditions of use for our enterprise GitHub outlined here before continuing with this training:   
   
>**Do not store data above Category 2 – See [DOH Data Classification Matrix](https://stateofwa.sharepoint.com/sites/DOH-hts/ITSO/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC38FF650-CF32-44A1-80BE-B390B816C2B3%7D&file=_Data%20Classification%20Matrix.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)**\
  >  Non-sensitive, publicly available data only\
  >  Absolutely no PII, sensitive health information, etc.
   
> **Do not upload code or other files containing credentials – Such as:**\
  >  API Keys, OAuth tokens, passwords, usernames, or other credentials\
  >  Server connection files or login information
   
> **We cannot create Public repositories**\
  >  Repos should be **Internal** and **Private** visibility only; public repos are disabled by enterprise policy
   
> **All members must abide by Washington State Department of Health policies and procedures and applicable State and Federal laws.**
